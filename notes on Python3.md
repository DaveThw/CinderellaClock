# Notes on getting Python OLA API to work (with Python3)

Install the OLA Python package (ola-python):
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ola-python
```

But... this only installs for Python2.7:
```
$ dpkg -L ola-python
/.
/usr
/usr/lib
/usr/lib/python2.7
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ola
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ola/ArtNetConfigMessages_pb2.py
.....
```

We might be able to just set up a symlink into the python3 dist-packages folder - suggested here:
https://groups.google.com/g/open-lighting/c/7TuvU0T1CAo/m/X8KeOfI8BgAJ
```
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ola/ /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/
```

Doesn't work - module `google.protobuf` isn't installed...
This message suggests how to install protobuf on Pyhton3:
https://groups.google.com/g/open-lighting/c/7TuvU0T1CAo/m/E2qJDgD3BAAJ
```
$ sudo -H pip3 install protobuf
```

Which does now seem to work! :-)
But user beware - there may be further issues with using python2.7 (OLA) code under python3...

-----

Yup, there are further issues!  If you try to add more that one callback Event with `wrapper.AddEvent(time, callback)` you get an TypeError: `'<' not supported between instances of '_Event' and '_Event'`.

It seems the OLA Python package is somewhat behind the GitHub code at https://github.com/OpenLightingProject/ola/tree/master/python/ola (ola-python dates to ~Sept 2018).  I can't currently work out the 'right' way to install the latest code from GitHub (without compiling the whole of OLA), but I'll try a bodge and see if that works...

Remove the symlink to the (old) OLA python package:
```
$ sudo rm /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/
```

Download the lastest code from GitHub:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:OpenLightingProject/ola.git
```
(I tried to run `make` on the `Makefile.mk` in `ola/python`, but (unsurprisingly, I guess) that didn't work...)

Symlink the python code:
```
$ sudo ln -s /home/pi/ola/python/ola/ /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/
```

Almost works... There's a few files missing: `rpc/Rpc_pb2.py`, `Ola_pb2.py` and `Pids_pb2.py`.  They are present in the ola-python package, and appear to be `Generated by the protocol buffer compiler`.  So... not sure if this will work, but how about we just copy or symlink from the ola-python code into the GitHub code...
```
$ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ola/rpc/Rpc_pb2.py /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ola/rpc/
$ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ola/Ola_pb2.py /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ola/
$ ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ola/Pids_pb2.py /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ola/
```

That seems to work (for now!)...
